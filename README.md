# HI_Intensity_Mapping_single_dish_telescope_simulations
To share scripts and data used to simulate single dish observations

The first script is an ipython notebook in which I compare 4 different types of primary beam models. 
A zip file containing the radially averaged meerKAT beams from 850 to 1000 MHz is included.
